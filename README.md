# bstar_tree.erl generated by the chatGPT AI

Playing around with this cool AI bot I asked:

    generate en Erlang program the implements a B* tree
    
I got the bstart_tree.erl module generated as a reply.

I only had a vague memory of the definition of a B* tree:
"a tree structure where each node could hold several elements",
used by Databases to store data efficiently on disc.

The complete program was not displayed in the output window
so I had to trick it by asking questions like "show me the last 10 lines"
or "only show the delete function".
The program still didn't compile due to some syntactical errors.

I asked for some type specifications and got them.

Next I asked it if it could 'output some EUnit tests', the output was
a bit too long to be displayed so I asked it to 'make it smaller'.

Finally I asked for some QuickCheck tests.

Very impressive!

But, unfortunately it doesn't work; it called a non-existing function:
lists:lastindex/2, so I added it. But the logic is still flawed,
and need to be debugged.

Close but no cigar... :-)
